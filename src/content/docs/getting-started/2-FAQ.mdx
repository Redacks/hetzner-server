- **Versatile Virtualization**: Proxmox enables the creation of multiple virtual machines on a single physical server, which proved handy for experimenting with various configurations or applications without disrupting my primary setup.

- **Learning Opportunity**: I wanted to learn something new and Proxmox seemed like an ideal platform for that. Its versatility and features made it an attractive choice for venturing into virtualization.

### Why Dockge and not Portainer?

- **Compatibility with Docker-Compose**: I like using Docker-compose files, and Dockge had what I needed in terms of features and compatibility.

### Why Opnsense?

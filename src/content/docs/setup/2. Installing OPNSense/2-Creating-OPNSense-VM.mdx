title: 2. Creating OPNSense VM
description: Creating and configuring the OPNSense VM

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

From the Proxmox WebUI we can now create a new VirtualMachine (VM). For that you can click on the button on the top right `Create VM`
For some settings you need to enable `Advanced` in the bottom right of the modal.

- General

  - Name: `opnsense`
  - VM ID: `100`
  - Start at boot: `Yes`

- OS

  - ISO image: `OPNsense-{version}-dvd-amd64.iso`

- System

  - Qemu Agent: `True` (That way Proxmox qemu can tell the vm to start, stop and restart when the qemu agent is installed)

- Disk

  - Disk size: `10-30 GB` (depends on the amount of firewall rules, configs and plugins)

- CPU

  - Cores: `2-4` (depends on the network traffic)

- Memory

  - `3GB-6GB` (depends on the network traffic and rules and plugins)

- Network

  - Bridge: `vmbr0 (WAN)`
  - Multiqueue: `8` (Allows for more internet speed)

## Post-Create

We now also need the add the second network interface that also allows OPNSense to use the VLAN "Network".

For that you need to select the OPNSense VM in Proxmox and go to the `Hardware` settings.
From there you need to click the `Add` button and select `Network Device`.

Make sure `Advanced` is enabled again to see all settings.

Settings:

- Bridge: `vmbr1 (VLAN)`
- VLAN TAG: `100`
- Multiqueue: `8` (Allows for more internet speed)

Now you can start the OPNSense VM and we can start configuring everything.

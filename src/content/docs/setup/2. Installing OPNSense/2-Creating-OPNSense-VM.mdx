From the Proxmox WebUI we can now create a new VirtualMachine (VM). For that you can click on the button on the top right `Create VM`
For some settings you need to enable `Advanced` in the bottom right of the modal.

- General

  - Name: `opnsense`
  - VM ID: `100`
  - Start at boot: `Yes`

- OS

  - ISO image: `OPNsense-{version}-dvd-amd64.iso`

- System

  - Qemu Agent: `True` (That way Proxmox qemu can tell the vm to start, stop and restart when the qemu agent is installed)

- Disk

  - Disk size: `10-30 GB` (depends on the amount of firewall rules, configs and plugins)

- CPU

  - Cores: `2-4` (depends on the network traffic)

- Memory

  - `3GB-6GB` (depends on the network traffic and rules and plugins)

- Network

  - Bridge: `vmbr0 (WAN)`
  - Multiqueue: `8` (Allows for more internet speed)

## Post-Create

<Aside type="note">
  This is only if you are using a setup with a singular IPv4. If you are using
  two, vmbr1 will be your second WAN and you will have to add it the same way as
  the first WAN. Then you can follow the next steps with vmbr2 which will then
  be your VLAN interface.
</Aside>

We now also need the add the second network interface that also allows OPNSense to use the VLAN "Network".

For that you need to select the OPNSense VM in Proxmox and go to the `Hardware` settings.
From there you need to click the `Add` button and select `Network Device`.

Make sure `Advanced` is enabled again to see all settings.

Settings:

- Bridge: `vmbr1 (VLAN)`
- VLAN TAG: `100`
- Multiqueue: `8` (Allows for more internet speed)

## Trunking

### Why Trunks?

Trunks are essential in networking setups, especially in VLAN configurations, as they allow for the transmission of multiple VLANs over a single network link.
By configuring Opnsense as a trunk, it can effectively handle traffic from various VLANs within the VLAN-NET environment.
Trunks help optimize network utilization and simplify network management by reducing the number of physical connections required.

### Configuration

To configure Opnsense as a trunk in the VLAN-NET, follow these steps:

1. Edit VM Configuration: Access the Proxmox shell and navigate to the VM configuration directory.

> ```
> cd /etc/pve/qemu-server
> nano 100.conf
> ```

2. Update net1 Configuration: Locate the configuration line for net1 in the file and append trunks=1-4095 to it. After the modification, the line should resemble:

<Aside type="note">
  This is only if you are using a setup with a singular IPv4. If you are using
  two, this will be net2 with `bridge=vmbr2`
</Aside>

> ```
> net1: virtio=BC:24:11:43:7D:C5,bridge=vmbr1,firewall=1,queues=8,trunks=1-4095
> ```

This ensures Opnsense functions as a trunk in the VLAN-NET.

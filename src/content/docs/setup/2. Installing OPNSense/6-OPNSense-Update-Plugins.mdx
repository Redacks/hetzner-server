description: Updating OPNSense & Installing QEMU Guest Agent
---

Next I personally update OPNSense and install the QEMU Guest Agent.

## Updating OPNSense

You should regullary update your OPNSense because it handels most of your server traffic and its the most vulnerable point of your server.
I would suggest running updates at least once a week or if you dont run critical stuff on your server atleast once in a month.

To update OPNSense go to `System/Firmware/Status`. There you should be able to `Check for updates`.
It should redirect you to the `Update` tab. It will give you an popup which you can just close.
You then need to scroll down and click `Update` at the bottom. You may need to confirm by clicking `Ok`.
After that OPNSense should automatically download and install the updates.

Sometimes OPNSense will need to restart after certain updates. Sometimes it will update the packages inplace.

If you are using `localhost` to connect via SSH Tunnel you may need to disable the firewall after that again.

## Installing QEMU-Guest-Agent

We need to install the QEMU-Agent Plugin to OPNSense. This is important because otherwise proxmox cannot shutdown the OPNSense when proxmox needs to reboot.
You also would not be able to stop OPNSense from Proxmox manually or restart it if the QEMU Guest Agent is not installed.
It also will display the IP's of OPNsense in the proxmox VM summary.

To install the QEMU Quest Agent you need to head to the Plugins section `System/Firmware/Plugins`.
There you will have to search for `os-qemu-guest-agent` and click the plus icon on the right.

This will install the QEMU-Guest-Agent.

In some cases the QEMU-Guest-Agent will not start automatically. You can check if it is running under `Lobby/Dashbaord`.
You should be able to see the QEMU-Guest-Agent in the Services Section.
If it has a red stopped icon you can click the play button to start it.
After that the icon should turn green, indicating that the QEMU-Guest-Agent is running.

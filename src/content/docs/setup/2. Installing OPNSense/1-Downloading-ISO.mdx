The best way to download the ISO for Opnsense is with the help of `wget`.

- For that first go to the download page of OPNSense. [https://opnsense.org/download/](https://opnsense.org/download/)
- As the image type you need to select the `dvd` installer.
- You can either copy the link from the download button or start the download in your browser and then copy the link of the file beeing downloaded.

To then download the file you need to go into the Proxmox console either via the WebUI or via SSH.
You then need to run the following commands:

```bash
cd /var/lib/vz/template/iso
wget https://mirror.ams1.nl.leaseweb.net/opnsense/releases/{version}/OPNsense-{version}-dvd-amd64.iso.bz2
bzip2 -d OPNsense-{version}-dvd-amd64.iso.bz2
```

After that you should have a OPNSense install ISO `OPNsense-{version}-dvd-amd64.iso`

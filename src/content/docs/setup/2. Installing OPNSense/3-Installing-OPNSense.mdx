title: 3. Installing OPNSense

If you did everything correctly you should be able to startup the VM.
For that you can go to the `Console` tab of your opnsense VM in the Proxmox WebUI.
To startup the VM if you didn't already otherwise you can click the `Start Now` button.

Wait until the opnsense installer finishes loading and prompts you with a login. Dont press any other buttons during installation otherwise you might need to restart the VM.

Because we want to install opnsense we use `installer` as a username to login and `opnsense` as the default password.

The OPNSense Installer will now prompt you with a keymap selection. I selected the `German` keymap, because I have a german keyboard.
If you want to you can test your keymap at the top of the selection.
If you are sure you selected the right keymap you can continue.

<Aside type="caution">
  If you select a wrong keymap you may have problems later when entering a
  password for your root user. Because some special symbols can be interpreted
  differently on different keymaps. This can lead to your login only working in
  the console not the OPNSense WebUI later on.
</Aside>

After selecting your keymap OPNSense will ask you how you would like to install it.
I selected `ZFS` for no particular reason. I just trust ZFS.

After that we select a `stripe` installation because our proxmox already has raid setup.

It will then prompt you to select a drive. You should only have one option available.
To select the drive press space and then enter to confirm.

It will ask you one more time to confirm because you will overwrite everything on the drive.
Because its only an empty virtual drive we can safely continue by selecting `Yes`.

After that the installation should start. This will take a few minutes depending on your server performance.

After the main installation finished it will prompt you to reset your root password.
I selected a secure password for my root user.

<Aside type="note">
  Make sure to remember that password. You will need to enter it in the WebUI
  and in the opnsense console sometimes. If you forget your password, you will
  have to reset your entire OPNSense
</Aside>

After that you can select `Complete Install` to finish the installation. This will reboot the VM and start of the actual drive now and not the ISO anymore.
If you want to you can remove the ISO, but you are not required to.

You should now have the basic installation running on your server.

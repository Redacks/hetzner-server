title: 4. Basic OPNSense Configuration
description: Configuring OPNSense WAN
---

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Next we need to configure the WAN for OPNSense in order to be able to access the internet and the WebUI of the Opnsense.

For that we will need to go into the Shell of our OPNSense VM.

From there you will need to login with `root` if you didn't already.

You will now have multiple options available. We want to start by assigning our interfaces correctly.
For that we will select option `1. Assign interfaces`

- Do you want to configure LAGGS now? `No`
- Do you want to configure VLANs now? `No`
- Enter the WAN interface name: `vtnet0`
- Enter the LAN interface name: (Enter to skip)
- Enter the Optional interface 1 name: (Enter to skip)
- `WAN -> vtnet0` Do you want to proceed? `Yes`

Next we want to assign the right IP address to the WAN interface.
In the `etc/network/interfaces` config we already configured a redirect to an IP address.
We will use this IP address as our OPNSense IP.

For that we will now have to select option `2. Set interface IP address`.

- Enter the number of the interface to configure: (Select your WAN interface)
- Configure IPv4 address WAN interface via DHCP? `No`
- Enter the new WAN IPv4 address: `10.10.10.1`
- Enter the new WAN IPv4 subnet bit count (1 to 32): `31`
- For a WAN, enter the new WAN IPv4 upstream gateway address: `10.10.10.0`
- Do you want to use the gateway as the IPv4 name server, too? `No`
- Enter the IPv4 name server: `1.1.1.1`

<Aside type="note">
  If you want to use IPv6, you will need to configure IPv6 in your
  `etc/network/interfaces` config and also configure IPv6 in OPNSense. You can
  still do so later from the OPNSense WebUI. I did not use IPv6 for my setup.
</Aside>

- Configure IPv6 address WAN interface via DHCP6? `No`
- Enter the new WAN IPv6 address: (Enter to skip)
- Do you want to change the web GUI protocol from HTTPS to HTTP? `No`
- Do you want to generate a new self-signed web GUI certificate? `Yes`
- Restore web GUI access defaults? `Yes`

title: 7. RFC1918 Alias
description: Creating RFC1918 Alias

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";


Next I create an alias for RFC1918. RFC1918 normally stands for all private IP addresses in your local network.
In my setup this alias is beeing used for rules that give internet access to a certain VLAN except everything inside of the RFC1918.
This makes it a lot easier to create internet access rules for the VLANs.

To create an alias head to `Firewall/Aliases`. There you can hit the plus icon to create a new alias.
As a name as already specified I will name it `RFC1918`.
The type should be `Network(s)` because I will be selecting all my internal networks.
As content I select every network that starts with  `__` so for example `__wan_network__` which would deny access to proxmox because its in the WAN network.

<Aside type="caution">
Make sure to update this alias every time you add a new network/interface to your OPNSense otherwise VLAN's could access devices on the connected network.

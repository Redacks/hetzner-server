First of all you have to set a root password for your proxmox server.
For that you have to connect to your server via SSH again.

<Aside type="note">
  During installation Hetzner will automatically copy the SSH-Key of the Rescue
  System or the Password to the newly installed proxmox server. You should be
  able to login with the same credentials.
</Aside>

We now need to change the root password in order to login to the proxmox WebUI afterwards.

**Changing the Password:**

- Open your ssh console and enter `passwd` in the console.
- It will then prompt you to change the root password.

After that, open your browser and go to the URL `https://<yourIP4>:8006`.

<Aside type="note">
  You may have to accept the risk, as your SSL certificate is currently Self
  Signed and the browser just doesn't trust them by default.

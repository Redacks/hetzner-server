I wanted to use VLANs on my server to be able to separate everything as much as possible even if its maybe a bit over the top. I started by configuring a vmbr0 bridge for WAN and internet access for the opnsense later. I also added a vmbr1 bridge for the VLANs later. I used a ovs bridge which you have to install first.

You can now carry out the following steps from your Proxmox shell which you can access in the Proxmox webui or your SSH console.

```sh
apt update
apt upgrade
apt install openvswitch-switch
```

If you want to copy my config look here [/etc/network/interfaces](../../configs/Proxmox/etc-network-interfaces/). There you will find my exact config to copy.
Make sure to remember or backup your current values.
You will have to replace the IPv4 and IPv6 address and gateway in my config with your current values.
To edit `/etc/network/interfaces` you can use either `vim` or `nano`.

```sh
nano /etc/network/interfaces
```

When you have adjusted the configuration you need to restart the server so that the new config can be applied.

  MAKE SURE THE VALUES ARE CORRECT OTHERWISE YOU WILL NOT REACH THE SERVER ON
  THE IP ANYMORE (HETZNER RESCUE MODE TO YOUR HELP)
</Aside>

```sh
reboot
```

### What did i configure?

All Requests to the server except on port 22(SSH) and 8006(Proxmox) will get redirected to the opnsense (static IP).
I only configured IPv4 you can also set it up for IPv6 if needed.

title: 1.4 Configuring Interfaces
description: Setting up the Network Interfaces
---

I wanted to use VLANs on my server to be able to separate everything as much as possible even if its maybe a bit over the top. I started by configuring a vmbr0 bridge for WAN and internet access for the opnsense later. I also added a vmbr1 bridge for the VLANs later. I used a ovs bridge which you have to install first.

You can now carry out the following steps from your proxmox shell which you can access in the proxmox webui or
in the Putty Console.

```
apt update
apt upgrade
apt install openvswitch-switch
```

If you want to copy my config look her [/etc/network/interfaces]. There you will find my exact config to copy.
But remember the values you read beforehand
You will have to adjust your ip4 and gateway to the ones given to you from proxmox.
To copy this config just use `vim` or `nano`
After that you will need to restart the server.

```
nano /etc/network/interfaces -y
reboot
```

> [!CAUTION]
> MAKE SURE THE VALUES ARE CORRECT OTHERWISE YOU WILL NOT REACH THE SERVER ON THE IP ANYMORE

### What did i configure?

All Requests to the server except on port 22(SSH) and 8006(proxmox) will get redirected to the opnsense (static IP).
I only configured IPv4 you can also setup it for IPv6 if needed

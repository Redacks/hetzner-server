<Aside type="note">
  When getting a new server at Hetzner without an installed operating system, it
  will automatically start in rescue mode.
</Aside>

<Aside type="note">
  If Hetzner is configured with SSH Keys, you will need to connect via SSH using
  the key. Otherwise, Hetzner will provide you with a root password for the
  rescue system when activating rescue mode. You can add SSH Keys under the
  Key-Management Section of your Server.
</Aside>

1. **Accessing Hetzner Robot Panel:**

   - Log in to your Hetzner account and go to [https://robot.hetzner.com/server](https://robot.hetzner.com/server).

2. **Activating Rescue Mode:**

   - In the Robots Panel you need to go `Server` and select your server.
   - Go to the Rescue Tab.
   - Click the 'Activate Rescue System' button.

3. **Rebooting the Server:**

   - Reboot your server. The best way is to use the automatic hardware reset from Hetzner in the `Reset` Tab.

4. **Accessing the Server via SSH:**

   - Use the following command in your terminal:
     <code>ssh root@\<ipv4\></code>

5. **Logging into the Server:**

   - When prompted for a username, enter "root".

6. **Using the Password (if applicable):**
   - If using the password provided by Hetzner, retrieve it from the Rescue Mode window.
   - Copy the password.
   - Login with the given password in ssh.

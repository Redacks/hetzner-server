To install Proxmox on my hetzner server, I used the `installimage` Script provided by Hetzner.

I used the `Proxmox-Bullseye` version. Because at the time of writing this Debian Bullseye is the most stable version of debian.

Go into your SSH Console and write `installimage` and choose `Other > Proxmox[...]-Debian-Bullseye`

In the install config I only **changed the hostname to proxmox.mydomain.com** and the disk size, because by default the config does not set the partition sizes right. I assigned as much as possible and also a bit of swap.

**Example:**

```
HOSTNAME proxmox.redacks.com
```

I also changed the disk size, because by default the config does not set the partition sized right. I assigned as much as possible and also a bit of swap.

**Example:**

```
LV  vg0 root    /       ext3    940GiB
LV  vg0 swap    swap    ext3    12GiB
```

Save (F2) and Quit (F10) the configuration file.
Also confirm the next two confirmations and wait until the installation is finished.

If you follow this the `installimage` script will automatically install proxmox with RAID. And will setup all basic configs to get started on its own.
After installation the server will restart and proxmox will then be accessible via port 8006 on your IP4-Address.
